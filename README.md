OSU 2025 Hackathon Project Submission for "Future of Learning" Track


In our project we made a website in which users can use to learn how to make a webpage using an interactive user interface to make their own button and play around with the size, margin, padding, border, and text of the button. Our webpage had problems connecting the front and backend, so the button functionality does not work, though in our code you can see where we had planned to change the button's states in the CreatePage.jsx file and how the backend would have been connected to the frontend to allow the user to play around with our webapp.

Though we were not able to include the user interaction, we found that we could still teach the user how the code would look and be implemented. To function in a normal webapp. We included some explanation blurb under the images. In our video submission you can see the code that was supposed to be shown in the images as well.

Overall our aim with our webpage was to help users be able to see how a webpage works, and what code goes into making a webpage. As many people like to learn with examples, but also see how they created the example.
